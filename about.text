    Registering a website name ( domain name e.g. website.com ) costs  money depending on your choice of a
    suffix for your website name (e.g. .com .net .space .co).

    To keep your website on the internet, you need to put your website on a computer with a 24/7
    internet connection ( a server ) that will display your website to users whenever they go to it( host it ),
    this also costs money( a subscription ).
